# Naming Conventions
Let's keep our repository directory as clear and easy to search as possible for others by sticking to the following naming conventions.

## The commandments of naming
1. All names shall be in lower case with a hypen inbetween each word.
```
vr-surveyor-meta-quest
```
2. Use the following project-platform structure
```
{project-name}-{platform}
e.g: amazing-app-windows
e.g: amazing-app-ios
```
3. Indicate backend, front end and full stack projects
```
For backends: amazing-app-api
For fronends: amazing-app-fe
For full stack: amazing-app-app
```
